A comprehensive, real-time intrusion detection, event correlation, and automated response orchestration system (SIEM + SOAR + ML) designed for modern enterprise network security operations.

---

## Executive Summary

AegisNet CNS is an enterprise-grade Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform integrated with real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) engines. By combining signature-based network inspection (Snort 3) with unsupervised Machine Learning (Isolation Forest) and stateful graph-based correlation (NetworkX), AegisNet CNS provides security analysts with sub-second threat detection, incident grouping, and automated active mitigation.

### High-Fidelity Hybrid Detection
Unlike traditional security platforms that analyze offline network logs retrospectively, AegisNet CNS performs **in-line live packet capture** using libpcap (Npcap on Windows) and routes raw traffic through Snort 3. The generated alert streams are enriched dynamically with ML anomaly scores, enabling the system to block known exploits using signatures while flagging novel zero-day threats through behavioral profiling.

### Key Architectural Pillars
- **Zero-Latency Alert Ingestion**: Persistent log tailing using an offset-tracked bridge daemon that streams alerts to Redis Streams and FastAPI.
- **Unsupervised Anomaly Profiling**: An Isolation Forest machine learning pipeline that extracts 19 statistical and entropy-based network features over a rolling 60-second window.
- **Stateful Attack Chain Correlation**: A correlation engine built on Graph Theory (using `NetworkX`) that groups discrete events into unified multi-stage incidents (Reconnaissance $\rightarrow$ Delivery $\rightarrow$ Anomaly $\rightarrow$ Action).
- **Sanitized SOAR Action Playbooks**: A thread-safe, command-injection-proof execution engine that interacts with Windows `netsh` and Linux `iptables` drivers to quarantine attackers in under 2 seconds.
- **Real-Time SOC Visualization**: A responsive React/Vite dashboard driven by persistent WebSockets that gives Security Operations Center (SOC) teams live incident management, timelines, and attack flow visualization.

## Developer Story

AegisNet-IDS (CNS: Cryptography and Network Security) was conceived to solve the classic security engineer's dilemma: **alert fatigue** versus **coverage gaps**. In typical corporate infrastructure, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are inundated with thousands of false positives and signature matches daily, while still remaining blind to zero-day attacks.

We built this project to prove that modern intrusion detection can be stateful, proactive, and automated. By pairing the signature-matching precision of Snort 3 with the unsupervised anomaly profiling of an Isolation Forest machine learning model, AegisNet-IDS detects both known exploits and unknown anomalies. 

To bridge the gap between detection and response, the system utilizes a persistent event-driven architecture using Redis Streams and Python. The stateful correlation engine uses network graphs (via NetworkX) to track attacker progression across the kill chain (Reconnaissance, Delivery, Anomaly, and Action) over a rolling 5-minute window. When a multi-stage attack pattern matches, the SOAR engine triggers automated firewalls drops (using Linux iptables or Windows netsh drivers) in under 2 seconds. The result is a resilient, enterprise-grade hybrid security framework designed for modern virtualized and physical infrastructure.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The system uses a distributed microservices pattern. Ingestion daemons running close to network taps (e.g., inside virtualized VMware networks) write alerts locally, which are sent to the core SIEM API. Background workers process alerts asynchronously via a Redis event bus, maintaining decoupled data stores for raw event storage, relational indexing, and real-time visualization.

## Core Components Deep Dive

### Snort 3 Ingestion Bridge

The Snort Bridge Daemon ([snort_bridge.py](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/core/snort_bridge.py)) serves as the primary system ingestion interface. Running locally as a background daemon, it is designed for high-availability log forwarding:

1. **Stateful Offset Tracking**: Tailing files in production is risky due to application restarts and log rotations. The bridge creates a pointer file ([alert_json.txt.pointer](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/alert_json.txt.pointer)) that saves the exact byte position in the file. Upon restart, it reads the pointer and performs a `.seek(offset)` to avoid repeating alerts.
2. **Rotation Awareness**: If the target log file size drops below the current pointer position, the bridge automatically identifies a log rotation, closes the existing handle, resets the pointer to 0, and opens the new file.
3. **Data Normalization**: It maps the Snort JSON schema to the AegisNet Unified Event Schema:
   - Snort rule priority values are mapped dynamically to standard threat levels: `Priority 1` $\rightarrow$ `HIGH`, `Priority 2` $\rightarrow$ `MEDIUM`, `Priority 3` $\rightarrow$ `LOW`.
   - Raw packet fields (`src_addr`, `dst_addr`, `proto`) are normalized, and the complete Snort metadata is packaged in the `raw` JSON field.
4. **Resiliency Mode**: If the core SIEM API is offline, the bridge enqueues alerts in a local memory buffer and publishes them to the Redis event bus if reachable. This keeps ingestion running without dropping alerts during API upgrades.

### Machine Learning Engine (MLEngine)

The system features real-time unsupervised anomaly detection, driven by the custom [MLEngine](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/core/ml_engine.py). It uses an **Isolation Forest** model to flag outlier activity that doesn't match standard traffic profiles:

- **Aggregated Window Features**: Rather than examining packets in isolation, the feature engineer ([feature_engineering.py](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/ml_services/feature_engineering.py)) evaluates traffic vectors within a rolling window:
  - **Packet Volume**: Total counts, rates per second, and rate-of-change statistics.
  - **Packet Length Profile**: Minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of packet lengths.
  - **Entropy Profile**: Shannon entropy of destination IP addresses, which identifies random target scanning or multi-destination beaconing.
  - **Connection Diversity**: Counts of unique source ports, destination ports, source IPs, and destination IPs.
  - **Protocol Balance**: Ratios of TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets.
  - **Traffic Directionality**: Count and ratio of internal-to-internal vs. internal-to-external communication.
- **Dynamic Anomaly Scoring**: The model produces anomaly decision scores. These are scaled to a user-friendly $[0, 1]$ range, where values $\ge 0.50$ (configurable in config.yaml) are classified as anomalous. The scoring logic triggers alerts for anomalous behavior, automatically elevating the alert severity to `HIGH`.

### Stateful Correlation Engine

Individual alerts can cause alert fatigue in security teams. The AegisNet SIEM Correlation Engine ([correlation_engine.py](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/siem/correlation_engine.py)) uses graph theory to group alerts into multi-stage incidents:

1. **Graph Construction**: The engine builds a directed graph (using `NetworkX`) for each source IP. Alerts are represented as nodes, and temporal edges are created between events occurring within 120 seconds of each other.
2. **Tactical Windows**: States are maintained in-memory for 5 minutes (300 seconds). After this window, stale graphs are cleared automatically to keep memory consumption low.
3. **Attack Chain Identification**: The engine performs path analysis, checking nodes against keywords that map to stages of the cyber kill chain:
   - **Reconnaissance**: Scan, Enumeration, Port probing.
   - **Delivery**: SQL Injection, HTTP exploits, payload downloads.
   - **Anomaly**: Anomalous packet rates, high entropy, custom ML flags.
   - **Action**: Command & Control (C2) beaconing, data exfiltration, database access.
4. **Probabilistic Scoring**: A confidence score is calculated based on active stages ($w_{recon}=0.2, w_{delivery}=0.4, w_{anomaly}=0.3, w_{action}=0.5$). If the attacker traverses multiple stages or if severity boosts (e.g., a `CRITICAL` alert adds $+0.2$) lift the score past `0.60`, a unified incident is generated and stored.

### SOAR Active Mitigation Engine

The SOAR Response Engine ([response_engine.py](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/core/response_engine.py)) handles automated mitigation. It evaluates security incidents and executes response playbooks:

- **Firewall Drivers**: The engine uses an abstract `FirewallDriver` interface to support multiple platforms:
  - **Linux Driver**: Interacts with `iptables` to insert drop rules dynamically.
  - **Windows Driver**: Interacts with `netsh advfirewall` to add inbound block rules.
- **Sanitized Execution**: To prevent command injection attacks, all IP addresses are validated using Python's `ipaddress` library before generating command strings. Commands are executed via `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` to ensure strict parameterization.
- **Snort Block Rules**: When an IP is blocked, the engine generates a Snort rule (e.g., `drop ip <attacker_ip> any -> any any`) and appends it to `generated_rules.rules`. It also records firewall block commands in `data/firewall_rules.sh` to allow rules to persist after restarts.
- **Safe Mode Protection**: In safe mode (`safe_mode: true` in config.yaml), the engine models the actions, logs the commands, and writes the rules without modifying the host firewall. This allows security teams to validate responses before enabling active blocking.

|  (User / IP) |           |  Monitor VM  |
+--------------+           +--------------+
```

Follow these steps to configure the virtual network:

#### Step 1: VMware Virtual Network Editor Configuration
1. Open the **Virtual Network Editor** as an Administrator.
2. Select the network adapter to monitor (typically `VMnet8` for NAT traffic, or `VMnet0` for bridged network access).
3. Ensure **"Connect a host virtual adapter to this network"** is checked.
4. Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the network settings.

#### Step 2: Virtual Machine Settings
1. Open your virtual machine settings page.
2. Set the Network Adapter type to **Custom**, and select the VMnet interface configured in Step 1 (e.g., `VMnet8`).
3. If running on an ESXi host or advanced hypervisor, modify the security policy of the virtual switch port group:
   - **Promiscuous Mode**: Set to **Accept**.
   - **MAC Address Changes**: Set to **Accept**.
   - **Forged Transmits**: Set to **Accept**.

#### Step 3: Windows Host Configurations (Npcap)
1. Download Npcap from [nmap.org/npcap/](https://nmap.org/npcap/).
2. Run the installer and check the option **"Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible mode"**.
3. Open PowerShell as an Administrator and verify that the VMware interface is visible:
   ```powershell
   Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.InterfaceDescription -match "VMware" }
   ```
4. Run the Snort launch script to select the active interface and start packet capture:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\run_snort_windows.ps1
   ```

## Threat Simulation & Verification Procedures

The platform includes a Threat Simulation Engine ([threat_simulator.py](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/scripts/threat_simulator.py)) to test detection and mitigation playbooks in a controlled environment.

```
                  +--------------------------------+
                  |    Threat Simulation Engine    |
                  |     (scripts/threat_simulator) |
                  +--------------------------------+
                    /        |           \        \
                   v         v            v        v
            Reconnaissance  SYN Flood    SQLi     C2 Beacon
             (Port Scan)    (Anomaly)   (Payload) (Correlation)
```

### Traffic Baselines

Before simulating attacks, generate a standard traffic baseline to train the Isolation Forest model:
```bash
# Generate baseline traffic for 10 minutes (600 seconds)
python scripts/simulate_network_traffic.py --duration 600 --intensity medium
```
Once the baseline traffic is logged in the database, trigger model training:
```bash
python back-end/ml_services/train_model.py
```
Verify that the output binaries are updated:
* [isolation_forest.joblib](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/models/isolation_forest.joblib)
* [scaler.joblib](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/models/scaler.joblib)

---

### Reconnaissance Attack Scenario

Simulate a port scan to verify signature-based rule detection:
```bash
python scripts/threat_simulator.py --mode live --target 192.168.8.100 --attack recon
```
* **Expected Result**: Snort triggers rule `sid:1000001` (Port Scan). The event appears in the SOC dashboard alerts feed in under 1 second.

---

### SYN DoS Flood Attack Scenario

Simulate a high-volume packet burst to test anomaly detection:
```bash
python scripts/threat_simulator.py --mode live --target 192.168.8.100 --attack dos
```
* **Expected Result**: The ML engine aggregates traffic features over the rolling window, identifies the outlier rate, and logs an anomaly score $> 0.85$.

---

### Web Application Exploitation Scenario

Simulate web application attacks (such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting payloads) to test signature detection:
```bash
python scripts/threat_simulator.py --mode live --target 192.168.8.100 --attack web
```
* **Expected Result**: Snort matches the payload patterns in the rule database, generating high-severity alert messages like `SQL Injection Attempt`.

---

### C2 Beaconing Scenario

Simulate a Command & Control beaconing pattern (low-volume, periodic connections over a long duration) to test the correlation engine:
```bash
python scripts/threat_simulator.py --mode live --target 192.168.8.100 --attack c2
```
* **Expected Result**: The correlation engine traces the attack path through the stages (**Reconnaissance** $\rightarrow$ **Anomaly** $\rightarrow$ **Action**), links the events, and generates a unified multi-stage incident (`INC-XXXX`).

---

## Security, Controls & Compliance

AegisNet CNS is designed to follow standard security compliance controls (such as SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and NIST 800-53):

- **Data Sanitization**: All incoming inputs, parameter strings, and IP addresses are parsed and sanitized using explicit models (`pydantic` schemas) to block SQL injection and OS command injection attacks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: User privileges are enforced via decorators at the API routing layer:
  - `analyst`: Can view alerts, incidents, anomalies, and logs.
  - `admin`: Full administrative access, including configuring SOAR rules, initiating ML retraining, and managing users.
- **Cryptographic Security**: Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` with 12 computational rounds. Session authorization is managed via JWT tokens signed with `HMAC-SHA256` keys.
- **Secure Encrypted Communication**: Includes shell scripts ([generate_ssl.sh](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/generate_ssl.sh)) to generate local TLS certificates. This ensures all REST API traffic, WebSocket streams, and dashboard interfaces run over encrypted HTTPS/WSS channels.

## Troubleshooting & Maintenance

The table below describes common troubleshooting scenarios:

| Diagnostic Symptom | Probable Root Cause | Verification Command & Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No alerts appear in the dashboard feed** | Snort is not capturing packets on the correct interface, or the bridge is stopped. | Run `snort --list-interfaces` in a terminal. Verify that the active adapter ID matches the configuration in [config.yaml](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/config/config.yaml). |
| **Backend boot crashes on port conflicts** | Uvicorn is trying to bind to a port that is already in use by another service (e.g., port 2346). | Run `netstat -ano \| findstr 2346` (Windows) or `ss -lptn \| grep 2346` (Linux). Kill the blocking process or set a new `API_PORT` in your `.env` file. |
| **MongoDB Atlas connection timeout** | The host IP is not added to the MongoDB Atlas network access IP whitelist, or credentials are invalid. | Log in to the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Navigate to **Network Access**, click **Add IP Address**, and add your public IP or choose `0.0.0.0/0` for testing. |
| **CORS errors in the web browser console** | The frontend domain is not allowed by the FastAPI CORS middleware settings. | Check `api/main.py`. Ensure that `allow_origins` is set to `["*"]` in development, or configured to match your exact frontend domain in production. |
| **ML Engine shows zero-shot/disabled mode** | The model files ([isolation_forest.joblib](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/models/isolation_forest.joblib)) are missing from the `models/` directory. | Run the training script manually: `python back-end/ml_services/train_model.py`. This will generate new model and scaler binaries. |
| **VMware traffic is not being captured** | Promiscuous mode is disabled on the VMnet virtual switch, or Npcap is missing WinPcap compatibility. | Re-run the Npcap installer. Ensure the WinPcap compatibility mode checkbox is checked during installation. |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### Q: How does the system handle high-volume packet bursts (e.g., 10Gbps+ networks)?
**A**: For high-volume networks, you can decouple the ingestion layer from the analysis workers by deploying the [Kafka Bridge](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/core/kafka_bridge.py). This allows you to partition and distribute message consumption across a cluster of backend analysis instances.

#### Q: Can AegisNet CNS block attackers automatically on the Windows host firewall?
**A**: Yes. If you configure `safe_mode: false` and `execute: true` under the `soar` block in [config.yaml](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/config/config.yaml), the Windows Netsh firewall driver will add inbound block rules dynamically when it detects high-severity incidents.

#### Q: How often should the Isolation Forest model be retrained?
**A**: We recommend retraining the model weekly or after significant changes to your network infrastructure. You can use the retraining scripts in [adaptive_learning.py](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/core/adaptive_learning.py) to configure automated retraining crons.

#### Q: Can I integrate external Threat Intelligence feeds?
**A**: Yes. The system has built-in integration points in the threat intelligence module ([ip_reputation.py](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/AegisNet-IDS/back-end/core/ip_reputation.py)). You can configure external API keys (like VirusTotal or AlienVault OTX) in `config.yaml` to enrich alert metadata.
