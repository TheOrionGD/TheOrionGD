# Developer Story

### Project Inspiration
The core inspiration for Echo Cortex emerged during a period of rapid organizational expansion. As teams transitioned to permanent remote setups across multiple global regions, we noticed a critical vulnerability in how organizations store knowledge: conversational leakage. 

Countless alignment syncs, sprint planning, and design reviews were held daily, yet the operational insights, assignments, and critical decisions generated inside those sessions dissolved the moment the call ended. Traditional methods, such as manual meeting notes, summaries, or wiki updates, were too tedious to sustain and prone to human bias. 

We realized that verbal sessions are high-velocity data assets. Our goal was to design an automated pipeline that intercepts these transient conversational flows and structures them into an immutable, structured relational knowledge graph.

### Meet the Team
Our engineering team combined expertise in UI/UX, database optimization, and machine learning to build Echo Cortex:
*   **ABDUL RAZEEK (Lead System Architect)**: Designed the hybrid storage architecture. Developed fallback paths and relational schemas in MongoDB Atlas and PostgreSQL to prevent data loss.
*   **GODFREY (Lead Frontend Engineer)**: Established the **Obsidian Stark** design system. Programmed the 3D neural lattices using Three.js and built responsive, high-performance dashboard layouts.
*   **HARIHAR (AI Pipeline & Relational Engineer)**: Orchestrated the multi-stage machine learning pipeline. Handled Whisper speech-to-text, Sentence Transformers vector mapping, and Gemini contextual recall.
*   **PRITHIVIRAAJJ (Security & Governance Specialist)**: Implemented cryptographic logging, local isolation profiles, role-based authorization middleware, and user privacy compliance tools.

### The Challenge
We faced a significant challenge during initial development: modern SaaS applications rely heavily on high-availability web APIs. If the cloud database cluster experiences latency, or if a user is operating in a network-restricted local environment, typical transcription and logging systems fail completely. 

Our goal was to design a platform that remains operational even when the primary database cluster is unreachable. This required building a local-first memory fallback system, database-independent configurations, and self-repairing vector maps that can re-sync when network connections restore.

### Design Philosophy
Echo Cortex is designed around the **Obsidian Stark** design language, which prioritizes data integrity and visual clarity through high-contrast, distraction-free layouts:
*   **Obsidian Foundation**: We chose a deep black background (`#050505`) to reduce eye strain and focus the user's attention on transcript data, dashboards, and charts.
*   **Stark Typography**: The interface pairs `Inter` for general UI text with `JetBrains Mono` for granular logs, code blocks, and configuration properties.
*   **Signal Elements**: We used neon green accents (`#00FF41`) to represent system health, alongside deep violet markers for active focus areas in transcripts.

### Engineering Journey
We began by coding the Express backend and testing the initial transcription pipeline. Early versions relied on sequential cloud API requests, which introduced noticeable processing latency. 

To address this, we reorganized the pipeline into parallel execution tracks, allowing speech-to-text conversion and feature vector extraction to run concurrently. We then integrated the Google Gemini SDK for conversational retrieval and built a custom React SPA layout utilizing decentralized import maps to speed up load times.

### Security-First Thinking
Because voice sessions contain sensitive institutional data, security was integrated directly into the system's core:
*   **Cryptographic Audit Trails**: The pipeline writes a SHA-256 hash of each ingested transcript to a compliance ledger, verifying data integrity.
*   **Scoped Authorization**: Backend routes are protected by middleware that checks user roles and API keys before allowing data access.
*   **API Key Isolation**: All external API calls (Hugging Face, Groq, Gemini) are handled server-side using secure environment variables, keeping API keys hidden from the client browser.

### Building the Consent Workflow
To comply with global data protection standards, Echo Cortex enforces strict consent controls:
*   **Explicit Recording Permissions**: The user interface prompts for explicit recording approval before accessing the browser's `MediaRecorder` API.
*   **Content Redaction**: The system allows users to flag speakers or mask specific terms within transcripts before committing data to vector indexes.
*   **Data Deletion Compliance**: Triggering the delete route purges the database entry and deletes all related vector embeddings and cached transcripts.

### User Experience Decisions
We designed the application around a single-page view with a collapsible sidebar, avoiding deep, nested menus. This layout lets users record sessions, review transcripts, inspect action items, and trigger comparisons in a unified workspace. We also added a 3D neural lattice backdrop via Three.js to represent the underlying vector database space.

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
*   **Handling Ingestion CastErrors**: When MongoDB went offline, Mongoose threw `CastError` exceptions when parsing custom local IDs (e.g., `m-17189234857`).
    *   *Solution*: We added explicit `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(id)` checks to bypass MongoDB lookups and search local memory when a non-standard ID format is detected.
*   **Whisper API Timeout Mitigation**: Sending large base64-encoded audio files directly via REST APIs occasionally caused socket timeouts.
    *   *Solution*: We configured buffered chunking and added a structured fallback script to return default data during API warm-up periods.

### Collaboration Story
Our team used an API-first development process. We defined the TS models in [types/meeting.ts](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/EchoCortex-Intelligence/types/meeting.ts) before writing any frontend or backend code. This decoupled approach allowed the frontend team to build layouts with mock data structures while the backend team worked on database schemas, controllers, and pipeline logic.

### Lessons Learned
We learned that AI systems must be designed for network resilience. Relying solely on cloud databases introduces vulnerability to external outages. By implementing local-first memory fallbacks and database-independent sync logic, we ensured that users can capture and store critical meeting records under any network conditions.

### Future Vision
Our plans for Echo Cortex include deploying local offline models (such as Llama.cpp and local ONNX runtimes), adding multi-speaker diarization, and integrating graph databases (such as Neo4j) to support deeper relationship mapping.

### Behind the Name
The name **Echo Cortex** represents the dual nature of our platform:
*   **Echo**: The acoustic signature of conversations and meetings captured by the system.
*   **Cortex**: The neural processing layer that organizes raw audio into structured, relational intelligence.

### Message from the Developers
> "We built Echo Cortex to solve our own team alignment challenges. We hope this platform helps your team secure knowledge, capture alignment, and maintain absolute structural clarity."

### 4. Horizontal Ingestion Timeline ([components/Timeline.tsx](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/EchoCortex-Intelligence/components/Timeline.tsx))
*   **React Props**: Accepts `segments: TranscriptSegment[]` and `onNodeClick: (segmentId: string) => void`.
*   **Behavior**: Maps speaker nodes along a chronological grid. Highlights key segments containing action items or decisions with neon-bordered containers.

### 5. Chat Interface ([components/chat/ChatWithNotes.tsx](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/EchoCortex-Intelligence/components/chat/ChatWithNotes.tsx))
*   **State Management**: Coordinates the chat input and history.
*   **Behavior**: Submits chat requests to `/api/meetings/chat` and streams the parsed markdown output from the Gemini LLM.

## 🧬 End-to-End Ingestion Pipeline

Ingesting audio or text reports triggers a 4-phase synchronization pipeline:

```
                  Ingestion Event Triggered
                             │
            ┌────────────────┴────────────────┐
            ▼                                 ▼
      [Audio WebM Buffer]             [Text Report Ingestion]
            │                                 │
     (Phase 1: Whisper STT)                   │ (Bypass STT)
            │                                 │
            └────────────────┬────────────────┘
                             ▼
                (Phase 2: Sentence Vectors)
                             │
                             ▼
                 (Phase 3: Database Sync)
                             │
                             ▼
                (Phase 4: Groq Extract JSON)
                             │
                             ▼
               (Phase 5: MMS-TTS Synthesis)
```

### Phase 1: Speech-to-Text Ingestion (Whisper)
When a user records a session, the frontend captures audio chunks using the browser-native `MediaRecorder` API (`audio/webm` at a 48kHz sampling rate) and sends them to the backend as an encoded base64 string. The backend processes the string, converts it to an audio buffer, and submits it to the Hugging Face Whisper API:
*   **Model Endpoint**: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/openai/whisper-large-v3`
*   **Authorization**: Uses the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable.
*   **Latency Mitigation**: If the external API is cold-starting or rate-limited, the system falls back to a default dialogue transcript to ensure database sync remains active.

```typescript
// Node.js implementation executing Hugging Face Speech-to-Text request
const audioBuffer = Buffer.from(audioBase64, 'base64');
const sttResponse = await fetch('https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/openai/whisper-large-v3', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.HF_TOKEN}`,
    'Content-Type': mimeType || 'audio/webm'
  },
  body: audioBuffer
});
const sttData = await sttResponse.json();
const transcriptText = sttData.text;
```

### Phase 2: Feature Extraction and Embeddings
Once transcription completes, the plain text is sent to the Sentence Transformers API to generate semantic search vectors:
*   **Model Endpoint**: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/pipeline/feature-extraction/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
*   **Output Vector**: A 384-dimensional dense array representing the semantic content of the transcript.
*   **Application**: Used for cosine similarity checks and semantic searches across stored sessions.

```typescript
// Node.js implementation querying Sentence Transformers embeddings
const embedResponse = await fetch('https://api-inference.huggingface.co/pipeline/feature-extraction/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.HF_TOKEN}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ inputs: transcriptText })
});
const embedData = await embedResponse.json();
const embeddingVector = Array.isArray(embedData[0]) ? embedData[0] : embedData;
```

### Phase 3: Relational Structure Extraction (Groq)
The plain text transcript is sent to the Groq API alongside a system prompt enforcing a strict JSON schema:
*   **Model**: `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
*   **JSON Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "segments": [
        { "speaker": "String", "text": "String" }
      ],
      "actionItems": [
        { "description": "String", "owner": "String" }
      ],
      "decisions": [
        { "summary": "String" }
      ]
    }
    ```
*   **Validation**: The backend parses the JSON payload. If the API is rate-limited, the system inserts default structured segments to maintain database consistency.

```typescript
// Node.js implementation executing Groq Structured Ingestion Analysis request
const groqResponse = await fetch('https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.GROQ_API_LLM}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: process.env.GROQ_MODEL || 'llama-3.1-8b-instant',
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "Analyze this transcript. Return ONLY a JSON object strictly following the structure: {\"segments\":[{\"speaker\":\"Name\",\"text\":\"Text\"}],\"actionItems\":[{\"description\":\"Task\",\"owner\":\"Name\"}],\"decisions\":[{\"summary\":\"Decision\"}]}" },
      { role: "user", content: transcriptText }
    ],
    response_format: { type: "json_object" },
    temperature: 0.1
  })
});
const groqData = await groqResponse.json();
const structuredOutput = JSON.parse(groqData.choices[0].message.content);
```

### Phase 4: Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS)
After generating decisions and action items, the system compiles the primary decision summary into a short text message and sends it to the Facebook MMS-TTS model:
*   **Model Endpoint**: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/mms-tts-eng`
*   **Return Payload**: An audio summary encoded in base64, allowing users to listen to the main outcome directly from the dashboard.

## ⚖️ Database Resiliency Policy & Schemas

Echo Cortex implements a dual-tier storage strategy to ensure high availability and prevent data loss during network disruptions.

```
              Ingestion Event Triggered
                         │
             Is MongoDB Active?
            ┌────────────┴────────────┐
            ▼ YES                     ▼ NO
    [Write to MongoDB]       [Write to Local RAM Cache]
            │                         │

                     ▼
             Postgres Sync (relational logs)
```

### In-Memory Fallback Operations
1.  **Format Verification**: Before querying the MongoDB cluster, the backend validates IDs using `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(id)`.
2.  **RAM Ingestion Route**: If a database connection is unavailable, or if the ID prefix indicates a local record (e.g., `m-`), the system queries the local in-memory storage array (`inMemoryMeetings`).
3.  **Active Sync Reconciliation**: When the connection is restored, local in-memory records are merged with MongoDB data. Duplicate primary keys are filtered out to keep client dashboards consistent.
4.  **Error Handling**: If both primary and fallback storage tiers are empty, the application returns explicit HTTP errors to the client rather than serving blank mock screens.

  transcript: string;
  embedding: number[]; 
  segments: any[];
  actionItems: any[];
  decisions: any[];

  decisions: { type: [Object], default: [] },
  summarySpeechBase64: { type: String, default: '' },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

export const Meeting = mongoose.model<IMeeting>('Meeting', meetingSchema);
```

#### User Schema ([models/user.model.ts](file:///e:/GitHub-Repos/EchoCortex-Intelligence/backend/src/models/user.model.ts))
```typescript
import mongoose, { Document, Schema } from 'mongoose';

export interface IUser extends Document {

## 🔬 Testing & Verification Guide

Echo Cortex includes a test script to verify that database connections and model interfaces are configured correctly.

### Running Endpoints Test Suite
Execute the test script from the root directory:

```bash
node test_endpoints.js
```

### Verification Assertions
The test script verifies the following features:

1.  **Health Check Validation**: Confirms `GET /health` returns an operational status code.
2.  **Authentication Handshake**: Submits credentials to `POST /api/auth/login` to confirm token validation.
3.  **Meeting List Retrieval**: Queries `GET /api/meetings` to verify database readout.
4.  **Ingestion Inferences**: Submits base64 audio data to `POST /api/meetings/ingest` to test the Whisper transcription and Groq schema parser.
5.  **Gemini Ingest Chat**: Submits a query to `POST /api/meetings/chat` to verify document recall.
6.  **Vector Score Ranking**: Validates similarity checks at the `/api/search` endpoint.

#### Expected Test Outputs
A successful test run will return the following console logs:
```
[ASSERTION 1] GET /health returning operational server status... PASS
[ASSERTION 2] Resolving authentication handshake... PASS
[ASSERTION 3] Fetching institutional meetings... PASS
[ASSERTION 4] Ingesting mock base64 audio buffers... PASS
[ASSERTION 5] Querying Gemini Conversational Recall... PASS
[ASSERTION 6] Validating vector similarity rankings... PASS
All verification tests completed successfully.
```

## 🛡️ Scalability & Security Considerations

### 1. Vector Search Indexing
As the vector database grows, searching across thousands of multi-dimensional embeddings can degrade query performance. To maintain search speeds:
*   **PostgreSQL Indexing**: Create an HNSW index on the vector database table to optimize similarity searches:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX ON meetings USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
    ```
*   **MongoDB Indexing**: Create an Atlas Vector Search index on the `embedding` array field, using `cosine` similarity with 384 dimensions.

### 2. Request Buffering and Rate Limiting
To protect external models (Hugging Face, Groq, Gemini) from API rate limits, the system uses rate-limiting middleware:
*   **IP-Based Throttling**: Restricts clients to 60 ingestion requests per minute.
*   **Queue-Based Processing**: Converts incoming ingestion tasks into sequential items in local memory, preventing server overloads.

### 3. Pipeline Performance Optimizations
We implemented three performance improvements in the ingestion pipeline:
*   **Optimization 1 (Vector Caching)**: Calculates embeddings only on updated or new transcript segments, saving redundant API calls.
*   **Optimization 2 (Client Compression)**: Compresses the base64-encoded audio payload using standard client gzip routines before transmission.
*   **Optimization 3 (Prefetching & Dynamic Bundling)**: Divides page views in Vite (`vite.config.ts`) using lazy loading, allowing components to load on-demand.

## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

| Question | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **How does the system handle database outages?** | The application automatically switches to local memory mode, saving new transcripts in a volatile array until connections are restored. |
| **What audio formats are supported?** | The pipeline accepts WebM, WAV, MP3, and OGG formats. We recommend WebM at 48kHz for optimal performance. |
| **Why is the Whisper API returning placeholder transcripts?** | This fallback is triggered if API key tokens are missing or if the external service experiences a cold start, keeping the ingestion workflow active. |
| **Can I clear cached data locally?** | Yes, you can clear the browser's storage by running `localStorage.removeItem('echo_meetings')` in the console. |

### Diagnostic Troubleshooting Flowchart
If you encounter runtime errors during ingestion, use this diagnostics checklist:

| Error Log | Probable Cause | Actionable Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `TypeError: fetch failed` | Express backend server is offline or port `2348` is blocked. | Verify backend status via `pm2 status` or run `npm run dev` in the backend directory. |
| `Mongoose CastError` | Invalid MongoDB ObjectId query on local memory fallback assets. | Verify ID prefix. If using local caches, bypass Mongoose queries and retrieve data from `inMemoryMeetings`. |
| `Hugging Face Inference Warm-Up` | Whisper model is loading into memory on remote host. | Wait 30 seconds and retry ingestion. The pipeline will automatically use mock transcripts in the interim. |
| `JWT Expired` | Client Firebase auth token has expired. | Re-authenticate the client user session to generate a new ID token. |
